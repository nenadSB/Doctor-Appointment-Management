The **Doctor Appointment Management System** is an **ASP.NET Core MVC** 
application designed for efficiently managing doctor appointments and patient records. Built with
**Bootstrap 5** for a modern and responsive UI and powered by an **SQL database**, 
it provides a seamless experience for healthcare providers. The application supports full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** 
functionality, allowing users to manage patient information and appointments effortlessly.  

### **Tools and Technologies Used**  

#### **1. Backend & Framework**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**  
  - **Purpose**: Provides a structured, scalable, and modular architecture for web applications.  
  - **Features**:

  - **Purpose**: Stores patient and appointment records securely.  
  - **Features**:  
    - Structured storage of patient and doctor information.  
    - Efficient querying using **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**.  

- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**  
  - **Purpose**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for database interactions.  
  - **Features**:  
    - Code-first or database-first approach.  
    - Migrations for managing schema changes.  
    - LINQ support for querying data efficiently.  

#### **3. Frontend & UI Components**
- **Bootstrap 5**  
  - **Purpose**: Provides a responsive and mobile-friendly UI.  
  - **Features**:  
    - Pre-styled components (forms, tables, buttons, modals).  
    - Grid system for layout design.  
    - Improved accessibility and responsiveness.  

- **Razor Views**  
  - **Purpose**: Handles dynamic HTML rendering in ASP.NET Core MVC.  
  - **Features**:  
    - Combines C# and HTML for generating UI dynamically.  
    - Supports form validation and data binding.  

#### **4. Authentication & Authorization**
- **ASP.NET Identity**  
  - **Purpose**: Manages user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).  
  - **Features**:  
    - Secure login and registration.  
    - Role-based access for **Doctors, Patients, and Admins**.  
    - Password hashing and token-based authentication.  

#### **5. Core Features & Functionalities**

  - **Create, Read, Update, Delete** for managing:  
    - Patient records.  
    - Doctor schedules.  
    - Appointments.  

- **Search & Pagination**  
  - **Purpose**: Allows users to filter and navigate large datasets efficiently.  
  - **Implementation**:  
    - **LINQ Queries** for searching patients and appointments.  
    - **PagedList** for paginated results.  

- **Form Validation**  
  - **Purpose**: Ensures data integrity before submission.  
  - **Implementation**:  
    - Client-side validation using **Bootstrap & JavaScript**.  
    - Server-side validation using **Data Annotations in C#**.  

#### **6. Deployment & Hosting**
- **IIS (Internet Information Services)**  
  - **Purpose**: Hosts the ASP.NET Core MVC application on Windows servers.  

- **Docker (Optional)**  
  - **Purpose**: Containerizes the application for easy deployment.  

- **Cloud Deployment (Azure, AWS, or Heroku)**  
  - **Purpose**: Deploys the application for remote access.  

#### **7. Environment & Dependencies**
- **.NET 7/8 (Latest Version)** - Core framework for the application.
